  description: 'The <b>Shameless</b> nature of the Succubus would make it seem like
    an easy mark for a cryptid lover of refined tastes, but in reality it can be
    quite tricky.


    Succubi are expert <b>Socialites</b> and outrageous <b>Meddlers</b>
    in the affiars of others. This means they are often around others and hard to
    approach alone.'
  hint: The Succubus will use social "mirroring" to hide in plain sight by sticking
    close to another guest during the event.
