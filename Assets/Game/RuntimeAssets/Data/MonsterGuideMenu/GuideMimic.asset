  description: 'The main ability of a mimic is to precisely copy something it has
    observed. This gives them a great eye for clothing and they are very <b>Fasionable</b>


    Since
    they usually have to pick a form to copy they pose as <b>Debutants</b> at events.
    They are also <b>Fiesty</b> in nature.'
  hint: The Mimic will pick a single guest and copy either the shape or colour of
    their mask and also appear in the same areas.
