  description: 'The Vampyrus Cometessa blends incredibly well with society. They
    play their immortality off as being the <b>Heir</b> of a long aristrocractic
    line.


    Their long lifespand and periods of sleep give them <b>Antiquated</b>
    attitudes; but also granted then <b>Affluent</b> welath.'
  hint: They require an invitation to enter a building, and have to lurk outside.
