  description: 'The Limus Multiformis, in the plebian parlence the "gelatinous ooze"
    is unique amongst the cryptids in that their traits don''t reflect the nature
    of the creature and instead are quiet <b>Reclusive</b>


    Instead they will
    earnestly attempt to fit in with society explifying the virtues of being very
    <b>Refined</b> and equally <b>Modest</b> .'
  hint: Outside of simple deduction with social traits there is no other known way
    to identify this cryptid.
